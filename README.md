# Simple Clicker Monster Game
#### Simple clicker game with HTML, CSS and Vue.js

This is a simple project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Vue.js version 2). I put 2 versions of project: the first called _"development-v1"_ (version made by me without copying the original) and the second called _"course-project"_ (original version).

Basically, the game (or project) works like this:

**ATTACK** - action that when is executed, player and monster each other, with a grater chance of the player losing the contest;

**SPECIAL ATTACK** - action that when is executed, player and monster each other, with a grater chance of the monster losing the contest;

**HEAL** - action that when is executed, player healed the life, but monster attack player in same time.

**GIVE UP** - Reset the game.

Both projects are with different CSS styles, so don't think it's "strange".

#### The 2 projects don't have the function of being a "decent" game, just to learn :) ####
